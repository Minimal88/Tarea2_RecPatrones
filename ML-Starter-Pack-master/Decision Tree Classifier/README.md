**Decision tree** is a type of supervised learning algorithm (having a pre-defined target variable) that is mostly used in classification problems. It works for both categorical and continuous input and output variables. In this technique, we split the population or sample into two or more homogeneous sets (or sub-populations) based on most significant splitter/differentiator in input variables.


#### Types of Decision Trees
  - Categorical Variable Decision Tree
  - Continuous Variable Decision Tree

##### Important Terminology related to Decision Trees
 - **Root Node**: It represents entire population or sample and this further gets divided into two or more homogeneous sets.
- **Splitting**: It is a process of dividing a node into two or more sub-nodes.
- **Decision Node**: When a sub-node splits into further sub-nodes, then it is called decision node.
- **Leaf/ Terminal Node**: Nodes do not split is called Leaf or Terminal node.
- **Pruning**: When we remove sub-nodes of a decision node, this process is called pruning. You can say opposite process of splitting.
- **Branch** / Sub-Tree: A sub section of entire tree is called branch or sub-tree.
- **Parent and Child Node**: A node, which is divided into sub-nodes is called parent node of sub-nodes where as sub-nodes are the child of parent node.

##### Advantages Of Decisoin Trees


 * Easy to Understand
 * Useful in Data exploration
 * Less data cleaning required
 * Data type is not a constraint
 * Non Parametric Method
